# How to get started

The tutorial examples in this section are a direct way to learn `xfac`.
While not aiming for completeness, they show the most obvious application of `xfac`, namely for the interpolation and integration one- and higher-dimensional functions. The tutorial examples are based on `xfac`'s Python bindings, called `xfacpy`, but whose API is very similar of the underlying C++ code.
More advanced usecases and explicit examples for the C++ API are found in the testcases, which cover the full scope of the library.
The testcases can be found in the `test` folder of the source-code repository.
A detailed description of the algorithm, which contains the mathematical definitions and further usescases in form of explicit code examples,
can be found in the main article on `xfac`.
